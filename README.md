Windows-Batch-Scripts
=====================

A collection of my batch scripts I made

The Tape drive scripts only work on Windows 2003 since it uses NTBackup.exe

Other scripts have been tested on 2003 R2 and 2008 R2

I hope some admin can use them like i did :)   comments in de scripts should be enough to learn how it works.

have fun
